# Implementation of Dictionary using Trie

Implemented a dictionary using trie comprising words with their relevant description and allow the user to populate it with large amounts of information and remain searchable acceptably and efficiently. The implementation is backed by a prefix tree and the word, meaning information is fetched from a file via file handling.

Key Features :
- Insert, search and delete words in the dictionary.
- Alphabetically printing the words.
- Prefix searching i.e. all words with the entered prefix will be displayed.
- Nearest neighbor search i.e. shows suggested words if the word you are looking for is not found.
